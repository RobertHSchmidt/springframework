SPRING WEB SERVICES

This directory contains a C# client for the Stock Quote Web Service that uses
Windows Communication Foundation.  The client can be built using the specific
build file, which requires WCF (.NET 3.0) on the patch.  Note that the stock
quote sample has to be running before invoking this target.
