Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 1.5.0 RC1 has been released! This release candidate release introduces:

* WS-Addressing support for both client and server, supporting the August 2004 and final versions of the specification,
* A new and improved XSD-to-WSDL generator that inlines included and import XSDs,
* Support for Spring Security
* Support for the Java 6 HTTP Server
* Two new samples, showing Plain Old XML usage and WS-Addressing with the Java 6 HTTP server

Additionally, there are other minor improvements and bug fixes.

Spring-WS 1.5.0 RC1 is the first milestone in the 1.5 series, which is now feature complete. The 1.5.0 series is 95%
backwards compatible, though support for Java 1.3 has been dropped, in favor of Java 1.6. Java is required 6 to build.

The next release in this branch will be 1.5.0, to be released around the 28th of March, unless a second release
candidate is required. After 1.5.0 final has been released, there will be a 1.0.4, backporting all bugfixes in the 1.5
branch.

For Maven users, please note that this release is not published at the central maven repository. Instead it is
published on Amazon's S3 service, like all Spring milestones. To use it, add the following repository to your POM:
