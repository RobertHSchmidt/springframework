Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 1.5.4 has been released!

This is the fourth bug fix and enhancement release in the Spring-WS 1.5
series. It fixes all bugs reported since 1.5.3 and introduces various
enhancements throughout the framework:

* Client-side XSD validation in the WebServiceTemplate, which allows you to
  make sure you conform to a provided schema.
* Ability to point the WebServiceTemplate to a WSDL Resource, extracting the
  location from it.
* Major speed inprovements in the DOM-based endpoint base classes 
  (AbstractDomPayloadEndpoint, AbstractJdomPayloadEndpoint, etc.).

and more, including more documentation. Please see the changelog for details.
