	    Web services development is a complicated affair. There is SOAP, there is REST. There is SOAP 1.1, and there is
        SOAP 1.2. There is rpc/encoded, and there is document/literal. There is WS-Addressing, WS-Security, WS-Policy,
        and various other Web service specifications. Implementing Web services using abstractions that magically turn
        Java into XML, but turn out to be leaky abstractions makes it even harder. Spring Web Services provides a
        solution for building interoperable Web services, while making it clear what XML is received and sent across the
        wire. Spring-WS provides a powerful <link linkend="ws">message dispatching framework</link>, various <link
        linkend="oxm">XML marshalling</link> techniques that can be used outside a Web service environment, and a <link
        linkend="security">WS-Security</link> solution that integrates with your existing application security
        solution.
