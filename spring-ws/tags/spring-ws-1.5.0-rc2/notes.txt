Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 1.5.0 RC2 has been released!
This release candidate contains new documentation, and some minor bug fixes.
Check the changelog for more details. 

Spring-WS 1.5.0 RC2 is the second milestone in the 1.5 series. The 1.5.0 series
is 95% backwards compatible, though support for Java 1.3 has been dropped, in
favor of Java 1.6. Java 1.6 is required to build.

The next release in this branch will be 1.5.0, to be released around the 28th
of March. After 1.5.0 final has been released, there will be a 1.0.4,
backporting all bugfixes in the 1.5 branch.

For Maven users, please note that this release is not published at the central
maven repository. Instead it is published on Amazon's S3 service, like all
Spring milestones. To use it, add the following repository to your POM:

<repository>
   <id>spring-milestone</id>
   <name>Spring Milestone Repository</name>
   <url>http://s3.amazonaws.com/maven.springframework.org/milestone</url>
</repository>
