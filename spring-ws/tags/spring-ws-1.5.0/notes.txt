Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 1.5.0 has been released!
This final release candidate the following new features over 1.0.3:

* Two new transports: JMS and email, both for client and server,
* WSS4J-based WS-Security implementation, which allows for WS-Security on
  non-SUN JDKs (i.e. WebSphere) and JDK 1.4,
* WS-Addressing support for both client and server, supporting the August 2004
  and final versions of the specification,
* Native support for Java 6, including JAXP 1.4, and the bundled SAAJ 1.3 and
  JAXB 2.0,
* Two new Spring namespaces, which drastically decrease the amount of XML 
  required to configure marshallers and typical Spring-WS constructs,
* Spring-WS jars are now OSGi bundles,
* A new, client-side interception mechanism, including WS-Security support,
* @Endpoints are now @Components, so they are automatically picked up when
  using Spring 2.5 component scanning
* A new and improved XSD-to-WSDL generator that inlines included and imported
  XSDs
* Support for Spring Security
* Support for the Java 6 HTTP Server
* Two new samples, showing Plain Old XML usage and WS-Addressing with the
  Java 6 HTTP server

and many small improvements and bug fixes.

We recommend upgrading to Spring Web Services 1.5 from all previous versions,
in order to benefit from these new features!

The 1.5 series is 95% backwards compatible, though support for Java 1.3 has
been dropped, in favor of Java 1.6. A week from now, we will release 1.0.4,
backporting all bugfixes in the 1.5 branch.
