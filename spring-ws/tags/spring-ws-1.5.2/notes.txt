Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 1.5.2 has been released!

This is the second bug fix and enhancement release in the Spring-WS 1.5 series. 
It fixes all bugs reported since 1.5.1 and introduces various enhancements
throughout the framework:

* Fixed WS-Security signatures when using WSS4J in combination with SAAJ
  messages (for real this time ;) )
* Drastically improved performance of writing to Axiom Message payloads

and more. Please see the changelog for details.
