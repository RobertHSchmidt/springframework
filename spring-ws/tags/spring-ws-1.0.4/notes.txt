I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 1.0.4 has been released.

Spring-WS 1.0.4 is a bugfix and enhancement release, addressing issues 
reported since 1.0.3 and introducing further improvements. We recommend to 
upgrade to Spring-WS 1.0.4 when running on JDK 1.3; for JDK 1.4+ we recommend
using Spring Web Services 1.5.0.
