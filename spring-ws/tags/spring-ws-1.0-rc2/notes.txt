This is the second release candidate of Spring-WS: a product of the Spring community focused on creating document-driven
Web services. This release mostly consists of bug fixes, the one major new feature is that the airline sample has been
rewritten to use more Java 5 features, including the new @Endpoint programming model, JPA, @Transactional, and more.
