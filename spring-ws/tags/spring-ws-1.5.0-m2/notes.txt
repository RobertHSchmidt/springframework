I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 1.5.0 M2 has been released! This milestone release introduces:

* WSS4J-based WS-Security implementation, which allows for WS-Security on non-SUN JDKs (i.e. WebSphere) and JDK 1.4
* Client-side interception mechanism, including support for WS-Security
* URI-based routing
* @Endpoints are now @Components, so they are automatically picked up when using Spring 2.5 component scanning
* The JMS support now supports TextMessages, in addition to the BytesMessages introduced in 1.5.0 M1.

Additionally, there are other minor improvements and bug fixes.

Spring-WS 1.5.0 M2 is the second milestone in the 1.5 series, which - in addition to the aforementioned features - will 
include support for WS-Addressing. The 1.5.0 series is 95% backwards compatible, though support for Java 1.3 has been 
dropped, in favor of Java 1.6. As of this milestone, Spring-WS requires Java 6 to build.

The next release in this branch will will be 1.5.0 Release Candidate 1, to be released around the 29th of February, 
After 1.5.0 final has been release, there will be a 1.0.4, backporting all bugfixes in the 1.5 branch.

For Maven users, please note that this release is not published at the central maven repository. Instead it is
published on Amazon's S3 service, like all Spring milestones. To use it, add the following repository to your POM:
