  <title>Meta-Data Schema</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>The Spring Batch Meta-Data tables very closely match the Domain
    objects that represent them in Java. For example, JobInstance,
    JobExecution, JobParameters, StepExecution, and ExecutionContext map to
    BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE, BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION, BATCH_JOB_PARAMS,
    BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION, BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT, respectively. The
    <classname>JobRepository</classname> is responsible for saving and storing
    each of java object into it's correct table. The following appendix
    describes the meta-data tables in detail, along with many of the design
    decisions that were made when creating them. When viewing the various
    table creation statements below, it is important to realize that the
    datatypes used are as generic as possible. Spring Batch provides many
    schemas as examples, which all have varying datatypes due to quirks in
    individual database vendors' handling of data types. Below is an ERD model
    of all 5 tables and their relationships to one another:</para>

    <section>
      <title>Version</title>

      <para>Many of the databse tables discussed in this appendix contain a
      version column. This column is important because Spring Batch employs an
      optimistic locking strategy when dealing with updates to the database.
      This means that each time a record is 'touched' (updated) the value in
      the version column is incremented by one. When the repository goes back
      to try and save the value, if the version number has change it will
      throw <classname>OptimisticLockingFailureException</classname>,
      indicating there has been an error with concurrent access. This check is
      very necessary, since even though different batch jobs may be running in
      different machines, they are all using the same database tables.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Identity</title>

      <para>BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE, BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION, and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION
      each contain columns ending in _ID, which act as primary keys for their
      respective tables. However, they are not database generated keys, but
      rather are generated by separate sequences. This is necessary because
      after inserting one of the domain objects into the database, the key it
      is given need to be set on the actual object, so that they can be
      uniquely identified in Java. Newer database drivers (Jdbc 3.0 and up)
      support this feature with database generated keys, but rather than
      requiring it, sequences were used. Each variation of the schema will
      contain some form of the following:</para>

      <programlisting>CREATE SEQUENCE BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_SEQ;
CREATE SEQUENCE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_SEQ;
CREATE SEQUENCE BATCH_JOB_SEQ;</programlisting>

      <para>Many database vendors don't official support sequences. In these
      cases, work arounds are used, such as the following for mySQL:</para>

      <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_SEQ (ID BIGINT NOT NULL) type=MYISAM;
INSERT INTO BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_SEQ values(0);
CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_SEQ (ID BIGINT NOT NULL) type=MYISAM;
INSERT INTO BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_SEQ values(0);
CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_SEQ (ID BIGINT NOT NULL) type=MYISAM;
INSERT INTO BATCH_JOB_SEQ values(0);</programlisting>

      <para>In the above case, a table is used in place of each sequence. The
      Spring core class <classname>MySQLMaxValueIncrementer</classname> will
      then increment hte one column in this sequence in order to give similar
      functionality.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE</title>

    <para>The BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE table holds all information relevant to a
    <classname>JobInstance</classname>, and serves as the top of the overall
    heirarchy. The following generic DDL statement is used to create
    it:</para>

    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE  (
  JOB_INSTANCE_ID BIGINT  PRIMARY KEY ,  
  VERSION BIGINT,  
  JOB_NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL , 
  JOB_KEY VARCHAR(2500)
);</programlisting>

    <para>Below are descriptions of each column in the table:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_INSTANCE_ID: The unique id that will identify the instance,
        which is also the primary key. The value of this column should be
        obtainable by calling the <methodname>getId</methodname> method on
        <classname>JobInstance</classname>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>VERSION: See above section.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_NAME: Name of the job obtained from the
        <classname>Job</classname> object. Because it is required to identify
        the instance, it must not be null.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_KEY: A serialization of the
        <classname>JobParameters</classname> that uniquely identifies separate
        instances of the same job from one another.
        (<classname>JobInstances</classname> with the same job name</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>BATCH_JOB_PARAMS</title>

    <para>The BATCH_JOB_PARAMS table holds all information relevant to the
    JobParameters object. It contains 0 or more key/value pairs that together
    uniquely identify a <classname>JobInstance</classname> and serve as a
    record of the parameters a job was run with. It should be noted that the
    table has been denormalized. Rather than creating a separate table for
    each type, there is one table with a column indicating the type:</para>

    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_PARAMS  (
  JOB_INSTANCE_ID BIGINT NOT NULL ,
  TYPE_CD VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL ,
  KEY_NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL , 
  STRING_VAL VARCHAR(250) , 
  DATE_VAL TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL,
  LONG_VAL BIGINT ,
  DOUBLE_VAL DOUBLE PRECISION,
  constraint JOB_INSTANCE_PARAMS_FK foreign key (JOB_INSTANCE_ID)
  references BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE(JOB_INSTANCE_ID)
);</programlisting>

    <para>Below are descriptions for each column:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_INSTANCE_ID: Foreign Key from the BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE table
        that indicates the job instance the parameter entry belongs to. It
        should be noted that multiple rows (i.e key/value pairs) may exist for
        each instance. </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>TYPE_CD: String representation of the type of value stored,
        which can be either a character string, date, long, or double. Because
        the type must be known, it cannot be null.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>KEY_NAME: The Parameter key.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>STRING_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is string.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DATE_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is date.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>LONG_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is a long.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DOUBLE_VAL: Paramter value, if the type is double.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is worth noting that there is no primary key for this table. This
    is simply because the framework has no use for one, and thus doesn't
    require it. If a user so chooses, one may be added with a database
    generated key, without causing any issues to the framework itself.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION</title>

    <para>The BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION table holds all information relevant to the
    <classname>JobExecution</classname> object. Every time a
    <classname>Job</classname> is run there will always be a new
    <classname>JobExecution</classname>, and a new row in this table:</para>

    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION  (
  JOB_EXECUTION_ID BIGINT  PRIMARY KEY ,
  VERSION BIGINT,  
  JOB_INSTANCE_ID BIGINT NOT NULL,
  START_TIME TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL, 
  END_TIME TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL,
  STATUS VARCHAR(10),
  CONTINUABLE CHAR(1),
  EXIT_CODE VARCHAR(20),
  EXIT_MESSAGE VARCHAR(2500),
  constraint JOB_INSTANCE_EXECUTION_FK foreign key (JOB_INSTANCE_ID)
  references BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE(JOB_INSTANCE_ID)
) ;</programlisting>

    <para>Below are descriptions for each column:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_EXECUTION_ID: Primary key that uniquely identifies this
        execution. The value of this column should be obtainable by calling
        the <methodname>getId</methodname> method of the
        <classname>JobExecution</classname> object.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>VERSION: See above section.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_INSTANCE_ID: Foreign key from the BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE table
        indicating the instance to which this execution belongs. There may be
        more than one execution per instance.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>START_TIME: Timestamp representing the time the execution was
        started.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>END_TIME: Timestamp representing the time the execution was
        finished, regardless of success or failure. An empty value in this
        column even though the job is not currently running indicates that
        there has been some type of error and the framework was unable to
        perform a last save before failing.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>STATUS: Character string representing the status of the
        execution. This may be COMPLETED, STARTED, etc. The object
        representation of this column is the
        <classname>BatchStatus</classname> enumeration.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>CONTINUABLE: Character indicating whether or not the execution
        is currently able to continue. 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>EXIT_CODE: Character string representing the exit code of the
        execution. In the case of a command line job, this may be converted
        into a number.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>EXIT_MESSAGE: Character string representing a more detailed
        description of how the job exited. In the case of failure, this might
        include as much of the stack trace as is possible.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION</title>

    <para>The BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION table holds all information relevant to the
    <classname>StepExecution</classname> object. This table is very similar in
    many ways to the BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION table and there will always be at
    least one entry per <classname>Step</classname> for each
    <classname>JobExecution</classname> created:</para>

    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION  (
  STEP_EXECUTION_ID BIGINT  PRIMARY KEY ,
  VERSION BIGINT NOT NULL,  
  STEP_NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  JOB_EXECUTION_ID BIGINT NOT NULL,
  START_TIME TIMESTAMP NOT NULL , 
  END_TIME TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL,  
  STATUS VARCHAR(10),
  COMMIT_COUNT BIGINT , 
  ITEM_COUNT BIGINT , 
  CONTINUABLE CHAR(1),
  EXIT_CODE VARCHAR(20),
  EXIT_MESSAGE VARCHAR(2500),
  constraint JOB_EXECUTION_STEP_FK foreign key (JOB_EXECUTION_ID)
  references BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION(JOB_EXECUTION_ID)
) ;</programlisting>

    <para>Below are descriptions for each column:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>STEP_EXECUTION_ID: Primary key that uniquely identifies this
        execution. The value of this column should be obtainable by calling
        the <methodname>getId</methodname> method of the
        <classname>StepExecution</classname> object.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>VERSION: See above section.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>STEP_NAME: The name of the step to which this execution
        belongs.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_EXECUTION_ID: Foreign key from the BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION table
        indicating the JobExecution to which this StepExecution belongs. There
        may be only one <classname>StepExecution</classname> for a given
        <classname>JobExecution</classname> for a given
        <classname>Step</classname> name.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>START_TIME: Timestamp representing the time the execution was
        started. </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>END_TIME: Timestamp representing the time the execution was
        finished, regardless of success or failure. An empty value in this
        column even though the job is not currently running indicates that
        there has been some type of error and the framework was unable to
        perform a last save before failing.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>STATUS: Character string representing the status of the
        execution. This may be COMPLETED, STARTED, etc. The object
        representation of this column is the
        <classname>BatchStatus</classname> enumeration.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>COMMIT_COUNT: The number of times in which the step has
        committed a transaction during this execution.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>ITEM_COUNT: The number of items that have been writtne out
        during this execution.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>CONTINUABLE: Character indicating whether or not the execution
        is currently able to continue. 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>EXIT_CODE: Character string representing the exit code of the
        execution. In the case of a command line job, this may be converted

      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>EXIT_MESSAGE: Character string representing a more detailed
        description of how the job exited. In the case of failure, this might
        include as much of the stack trace as is possible.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT</title>

    <para>The BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT table holds all information
    relevant to an <classname>ExecutionContext</classname>. There is exactly
    one <classname>ExecutionContext</classname> per
    <classname>StepExecution</classname>, and it contains all user defined
    key/value pairs that need to persisted for a particular job run. This data
    is usually state information that must be retrieved back after a failure
    so that a JobInstance can 'start from where it left off'. As with the
    BATCH_JOB_PARAMS table, this table has been denormalized and uses a column
    to determine the type:</para>

    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT  (
  STEP_EXECUTION_ID BIGINT NOT NULL ,
  TYPE_CD VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL ,
  KEY_NAME VARCHAR(1000) NOT NULL , 
  STRING_VAL VARCHAR(1000) , 
  DATE_VAL TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL ,
  LONG_VAL VARCHAR(10) ,
  DOUBLE_VAL DOUBLE PRECISION ,
  OBJECT_VAL BLOB,
  constraint STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT_FK foreign key (STEP_EXECUTION_ID)
  references BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION(STEP_EXECUTION_ID)
) ;</programlisting>

    <para>Below are descriptions for each column:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>STEP_EXECUTION_ID: Foreign key representing the
        <classname>StepExecution</classname> to which the context belongs.
        There may be more than one row associated to a given
        <classname>StepExecution</classname>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>TYPE_CD: String representation of the type of value stored,
        which can be either a character string, date, long, or double. Because
        the type must be known, it cannot be null.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>KEY_NAME: The Parameter key.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>STRING_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is string.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DATE_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is date.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>LONG_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is a long.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DOUBLE_VAL: Paramter value, if the type is double.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>OBJECT_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is a blob.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>When an ExecutionContext is stored, values that are one of the well
    known types above will be stored as their respective type. Any unknown
    type will be serialized to a blob and stored in the OBJECT_VAL column. As
    with BATCH_JOB_PARAMS, there is no primary key for this table. This is
    simply because the framework has no use for one, and thus doesn't require
    it. If a user so chooses, one may be added with a database generated key,
    without causing any issues to the framework itself.</para>
