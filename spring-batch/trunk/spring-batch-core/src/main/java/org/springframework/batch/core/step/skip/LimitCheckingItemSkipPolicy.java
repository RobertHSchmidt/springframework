/**
 * <p>
 * {@link ItemSkipPolicy} that determines whether or not reading should continue
 * based upon how many items have been skipped. This is extremely useful
 * behavior, as it allows you to skip records, but will throw a
 * {@link SkipLimitExceededException} if a set limit has been exceeded. For
 * example, it is generally advisable to skip {@link FlatFileParseException}s,
 * however, if the vast majority of records are causing exceptions, the file is
 * likely bad.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, it is also likely that you only want to skip certain exceptions.
 * {@link FlatFileParseException} is a good example of an exception you will
 * likely want to skip, but a {@link FileNotFoundException} should cause
 * immediate termination of the {@link Step}. Because it would be impossible
 * for a general purpose policy to determine all the types of exceptions that
 * should be skipped from those that shouldn't, two lists must be passed in,
 * with all of the exceptions that are 'fatal' and 'skippable'. The two lists
 * are not enforced to be exclusive, they are prioritized instead - exceptions
 * that are fatal will never be skipped, regardless whether the exception can
 * also be classified as skippable.
