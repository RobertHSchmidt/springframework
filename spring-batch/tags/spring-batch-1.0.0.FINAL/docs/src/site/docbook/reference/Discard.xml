    <title id="s.5.2">Support Stereotypes</title>

    <para>While item readers and writers serve as the main entry points for
    item-oriented processing, they might be supplemented by a number of
    support classes that perform specific tasks within the reader / writer
    lifecycle. These support stereotypes are useful for dividing the work of
    item readers and writers into reusable pieces, as well as abstracting away
    the details of processing, such as interaction with external systems.
    Additionally, they give us another opportunity to leverage the powerful
    configuration features of the Spring framework, as we can switch between
    several beans implementing these support interfaces without changing the
    driving item reader or writer.</para>

      <title id="s.2.4.2">Item Transformers</title>

      <para>An item transformer is a class that is capable of taking an object
      and changing it somehow before processing occurs. For instance, an item
      transformer my alter an object by changing its properties or by
      replacing it with another object entirely, such as a wrapper or
      derivative object. It can also be defined as an adaptor, allowing an
      object of one type to be converted for use as an object of a second
      type.</para>
