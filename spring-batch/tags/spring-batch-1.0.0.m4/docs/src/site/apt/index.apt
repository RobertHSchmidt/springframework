  If youare seeing this page you probably built Spring Batch from the
  SVN soure code.  The real documentation is still work in progress
  and will be released here shortly.  Meanwhile you can get the latest
  and greatest at the Spring Batch home page
  http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/docs.
