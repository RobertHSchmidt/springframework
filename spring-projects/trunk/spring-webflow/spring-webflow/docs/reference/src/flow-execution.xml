		<para>
			Once a flow has been defined any number of executions of it can be launched in parallel 
			at runtime.  Execution of a flow is carried out by a dedicated system that 
			is based internally on a state machine that runs atop the Java VM.  As the life of an
			flow execution can span more than one request into the server, this system 
			is also responsible for persisting execution state across requests.
		</para>
		<para>
			This chapter documents Spring Web Flow's flow execution system.  You'll
			learn the core constructs of the system and how to execute flows out-of-container 
			within a JUnit test environment.

		    A <literal>FlowExecution</literal> is a runtime instantiation of a flow definition.
		    Given a single <literal>FlowDefinition</literal> any
		    number of independent flow executions may be created, typically by a
		    <literal>FlowExecutionFactory</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
		    A flow execution carries out the execution of program instructions defined within
		    its definition in response to user events.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>
				It may be helpful to think of a flow definition as analagous to a Java <literal>Class</literal> and a 
				flow execution as analagous to an object instance of that <literal>Class</literal>.  Signaling
				an execution event can be considered analagous to sending an object a message.

			Once created, a new flow execution is initially inactive, waiting to be started.  Once

			to continue or it terminates.

			When a flow execution reaches a state where input is required to continue it is said to have <emphasis>paused</emphasis>,

			User input is provided by <emphasis>signaling an event</emphasis> that
			<emphasis>resumes</emphasis> the flow execution by communicating what user action was taken.
			Attributes of the signal event request form the basis for user input.  The flow execution 
			resumes by consuming the event.
		</para>
		<para>
			Once a flow execution has resumed it continues executing until it again enters a 
			state where more input is needed or it terminates.  Once a flow execution has terminated
			it becomes inactive and cannot be resumed.
