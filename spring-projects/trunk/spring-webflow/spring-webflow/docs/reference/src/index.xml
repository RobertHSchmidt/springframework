		<title>History and acknowledgements</title>
		<para>
			The Spring Web Flow project has come a long way since it started in february of 2005.
		</para>
		<para>
			The current Spring Web Flow project has it's roots in a much simpler web flow product
			that was developed in late 2004 by Erwin Vervaet
			(see http://www.ervacon.com/products/springwebflow/). On the 2nd of february 2005
			Keith Donald contacted Erwin to see if he would be interested in promoting the Ervacon
			Spring Web Flow project into an offical Spring Framework sub project. The rest is
			history as they say.
		</para>
		<para>
			Keith and Erwin put in countless hours and the project quickly matured into a feature
			reach and stable web flow system. The <emphasis>PR5</emphasis> (Preview 5) release
			proved to be a milestone, gaining widespread adoption, particularly for software in a
			preview release. Further insights and enhancements have lead to the current Spring
			Web Flow: an easy to use and extremely powerful web flow solution.
		</para>
		<para>
			The Spring Web Flow project would not have been able to mature into the system it is
			now without the help of several individuals and companies. Keith Donald is without
			a doubt the driving force behind the product. Several of his Interface21 colleagues
			also invested considerable time and expertise: Rob Harrop, Colin Sampaleanu, Juergen
			Hoeller and Ben Hale deserve particular mention. The community that formed around
			Spring Web Flow also deserves credit. Several community members provided valueable
			input into the product: J.Enrique Ruiz, César Ordiñana, Steven Bazyl, Colin Yates
			and Seth Ladd.
