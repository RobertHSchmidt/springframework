/**
 * Convenient implementation that encapsulates the assembly of a default flow
 * execution repository factory that creates repositories that generate one
 * {@link FlowExecutionKey} per persistent FlowExecution. The assigned key
 * remains the same through the life of the FlowExecution.
 * 
 * Useful to support so called "conversation-redirects", where after each POST a
 * redirect occurs to a flow execution URL. Because the flow execution maintains
 * the same key throughout its life the URL never changes for the duration of
 * the interaction.
