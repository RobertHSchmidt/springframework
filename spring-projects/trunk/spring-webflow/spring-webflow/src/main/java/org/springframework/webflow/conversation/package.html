<p>
The conversation subsystem for beginning and ending conversations that manage the state of user interactions.
</p>
<p>
The central concept defined by this package is the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.conversation.ConversationManager}, representing
a service interface for managing conversations.
</p>
<p>
This package serves as a portable conversation management abstraction and does not depend on 
the Spring Web Flow engine. It mirrors the flow execution and flow execution repository subsystems for
the management of conversations.
