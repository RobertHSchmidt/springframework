The conversation subsystem, for beginning and ending conversations that manage the state of user interactions.
</p>

The central concept defined by this package is the
{@link org.springframework.webflow.execution.repository.conversation.ConversationService}, representing
a service interface for managing conversations.

This package serves as a portable conversation management abstraction and does not depend on 
the core of Spring Web Flow.
