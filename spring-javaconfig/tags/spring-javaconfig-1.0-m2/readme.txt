-----------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

Spring JavaConfig offers a Java-based alternative to configuring Spring Application Contexts. 
While most people currently use XML to configure bean definitions in their Application Contexts, 
Spring's versatility and metadata based internal handling of bean definitions means alternatives 
to XML config are easy to implement.
