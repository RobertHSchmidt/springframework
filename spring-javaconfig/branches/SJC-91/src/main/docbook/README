Docbook sources for Spring JavaConfig.

Organization:
------------
The documentation is broken down into parts and chapters, per DocBook
conventions.  index.xml lays out the three parts of the book and imports in all
chapters as XML entities.  The chapters/ directory contains individual chapter
XML fragments.

Building:
--------
To generate the HTML and PDF, run the following commands, respectively from the
root of the project (trunk):

    mvn docbkx:generate-pdf
    mvn docbkx:generate-html

Formatting:
----------
To format the sources, download the free XMLMind program.  At this time,
formatting is not strict, but rather being managed by hand generally in
accordance with the original conventions laid out by XMLMind.
