For the moment, the project has just been taken out of the sandbox and there are some loose ends, notably
building scripts. The tests reply on some classes available inside Spring sandbox and test folder which are
not distributed which means that in order to run the tests, one needs Spring full source compiled and available
inside the classpath.

A work-around for non-Eclipse users will soon follow.
