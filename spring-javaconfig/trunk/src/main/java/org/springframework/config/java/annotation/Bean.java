/**
 * Annotation to be applied to methods that create beans in a Spring context.
 * The name of the bean is the method name. (It is also possible to specify
 * aliases using the aliases array on this annotation.)
 * <p>
 * Contains similar information to that held in Spring's internal BeanDefinition
 * metadata.
 * <p>
 * Bean creation methods must be public or protected. Bean creation methods may
 * throw any exception, which will be caught and handled by the Spring container
 * on processing of the configuration class. <br>
 * Bean creation methods must return an object type. The decision to return a
 * class or an interface will be significant in the event of proxying. Bean
 * methods that return interfaces will be proxied using dynamic proxies; those
 * that return a class will require CGLIB or other subclass-based proxying.
 * Return an interface as possible, as this is also consistent with best
 * practice around loose coupling.
 * <p>
 * Bean creation methods may reference other bean creation methods by calling
 * them directly, as follows. This ensures that references between beans are
 * strongly typed: <code>
 * @Bean
 * public Company interface21() {
 * 	    Company company = new DefaultCompany("Interface21");
 *      company.setChiefScientist(adrian());
 *      return company;
 * }
 * 
 * @Bean
 * public Person adrian() {
 * 	     return new Person("Adrian Colyer");
 * }
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * If a bean creation method is protected, rather than public, the the bean will
 * be hidden. This means that the bean will be added to a child factory used
 * internally by the ConfigurationProcessor, rather than the main factory,
 * meaning it won't be visible to other definitions. This is particularly useful
 * for Spring AOP Advisors or AspectJ aspects, which might otherwise alter
 * behaviour of the owning factory as a whole.
