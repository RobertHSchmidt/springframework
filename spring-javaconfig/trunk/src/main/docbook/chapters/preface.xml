  <title>Preface to the third milestone release</title>
  <para>TODO: discuss the 'state of the union' with JavaConfig.  Many users have
  asked 'when are we going 1.0'; we've found that a good number of people and
  organizations are already using M2 in production, while others have (rightly)
  expressed concern about doing so due to the pre-GA state of the project and
  it's documented 'experimental' status.  How has this changed with M3?  What
  should users expect in terms of API changes between now and 1.0?  For example,
  AOP support in SJC merits a good hard looking at
  (<classname>@Aspect</classname> annotations on
  <classname>@Configuration</classname> classes and other awkwardness).</para>

  <para>IMO: Generally, we should set people up that while SJC has enjoyed some positive
  usage and feedback, it remains pre-1.0 for a reason, and that we don't want to
  prematurely put something out there that is not really ready for primetime.  The
  internals are stable, yes, but is the programming model right?  Right enough to
  commit to backward compatibility?  The team needs to discuss all this, and we
  will shortly.</para>
