  <title>Preface to the third milestone release</title>

  <para>We're proud to announce this third milestone (M3) of the JavaConfig project.
  Much has happened in the long months since M2, including a healthy dose of user
  feedback.  The good news is that we've learned users seem to like JavaConfig
  and the programming model works well for most needs.  Thanks to everyone that
  has participated in the process thus far, including Rick Hightower, Solomon Duskis,
  Ben Rowlands, Craig Walls, Jim Moore, and many others.</para>

  <para>M3 includes 20+ bug fixes and feature additions.  See <xref linkend="new-and-noteworthy-1.0.0.m3"/>
  for details.  As a special note to existing users, M3 introduces one fairly major change to the
  existing core API - the deprecation of <classname>AnnotationApplicationContext</classname>
  in favor of its replacement, <classname> JavaConfigApplicationContext</classname>.
  <classname>AnnotationApplicationContext</classname> will remain deprecated in the codebase up until the
  1.0 GA release, at which time it will be deleted permanently.  So take heed and swap out references
  as soon as you can.</para>

  <para>Future milestones and RCs on the path to 1.0 may include other breaking
  API changes.  The core public API (annotations, application contexts, and key util classes)
  will not likely change radically, but internal APIs almost certainly will.  It is important
  to the team that the packaging structure and internals of JavaConfig are 'just right' in
  order to facilitate flexible evolution and solid backward compatibility post-1.0.</para>

  <para>What's needed now is users, users, and more users!  Please don't hesitate to contact
  the team via <ulink url="http://jira.springframework.org/browse/SJC">JIRA issue tracking</ulink>
  with anything you see missing from JavaConfig.</para>
