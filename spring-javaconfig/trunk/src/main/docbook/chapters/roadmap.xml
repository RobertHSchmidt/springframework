  <para>SJC has been a work in progress for some time now. To the benefit
  of the project, this means that there has been a long period of user
  feedback and experience before a GA release. Of course, the downside of
  this is that there's no GA release suitable for use in production. In
  the process of putting together the M3 release, it has become clear that
  there are several key aspects of JavaConfig that deserve re-thinking and
  re-working. It is important that we get the JavaConfig programming model
  'as right as possible' before the 1.0 release, because after that we
  will be bound by backward compatibility forever (or at least until 2.0).
  For this reason, the team is not rushing a 1.0 release 'out the door'.
  There is more work to do, and it may result in another milestone before
  beginning the release candidate process for 1.0. Things that work for
  you now may break very shortly. What we need most is your feedback!
  Please try out the new features listed in <xref
