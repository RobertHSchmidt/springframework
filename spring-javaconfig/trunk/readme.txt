-----------------------------------
http://www.springframework.org/javaconfig

1. INTRODUCTION

Spring JavaConfig offers a Java-based option for configuring Spring Application Contexts. 
While most people currently use XML to configure bean definitions in their Application Contexts, 
Spring's versatility and metadata based internal handling of bean definitions means alternatives 
to XML config are easy to implement.

2. RELEASE INFO

The Spring JavaConfig is targeted at Spring 2.5 and above and JDK level 1.5 and above.

Release contents:
* "src" contains the Java source files for the framework
* "docs" contains the api documentation (JavaDoc) as well as the reference manual in both PDF and HTML form
* "dist" contains JavaConfig distribution zips
* "samples" contains the samples Java source files (NOTE: currently out-of-date, will be fixed in a later milestone. See SJC-76)

The "lib" directory is just included in the "-with-dependencies" download. Make sure to download this full
distribution ZIP file if you want to run the sample applications and/or build the framework yourself.

4. WHERE TO START

This distribution contains API documentation, a reference manual and a sample applications illustrating the current features of Spring JavaConfig.
Please refer to the official Spring JavaConfig site for more material on Spring JavaConfig.

A great way to get started is to review and run the sample applications, supplementing with reference manual
material as needed. You will require Maven 2, which can be downloaded from http://maven.apache.org/, for building
Spring JavaConfig. (Again, note that samples are out of date, and will be updated during a later milestone)
