Changes in version 1.0.0.m3 (2008-03-26)
--------------------------------------

General
* major update to documentation
* internal refactoring to eliminate cyclic dependencies & reduce number of classes in public API
* changed versioning scheme (1.0 -> 1.0.0) to support OSGi conventions
* bean visibility: private @Bean methods are no longer supported (never worked properly anyway)
* minimized dependencies
* abstract @Configuration classes no longer registered unless one @ExternalBean, @ExternalValue or @AutoBean is present

Package org.springframework.config.java.annotation
* added @Import (works like XML's <import/> element)
* added @ExternalValue and @ResourceBundles to facilitate externalizing string values
* added Primary enum to support disambiguation in autowiring cases and when using new type-safe getBean() method
* @Configuration is now annotated as @Component to support classpath scanning
* @Bean 'allowOverriding' attribute now defaults to 'true'

Package org.springframework.config.java.annotation
* removed @SpringAdvice, @SpringAdvisor and related support (favor @Aspect-style)

Package org.springframework.config.java.context
* renamed ApplicationAnnotationContext to JavaConfigApplicationContext
* deprecated ApplicationAnnotationContext
* added type-safe getBean() methods to JavaConfigApplicationContext
* added JavaConfigWebApplicationContext to facilitate using JavaConfig directly in the web tier

Package org.springframework.config.java.process
* ConfigurationProcessor now treats any inner @Configuration classes as child application contexts

Package org.springframework.config.java.util
* eliminated ClassUtils and ScopeUtils by refactoring static methods into the classes that use them

Package org.springframework.config.java.valuesource
* added ValueSource interface and various implementations to support @ExternalValue functionality mentioned above


Changes in version 1.0-m2a (2007-05-10)
---------------------------------------
* fixed (a confusing) documentation typo. The binary code is identical to 1.0-m2 (the reason why the jar have the same name).


Changes in version 1.0-m2 (2007-05-08)
--------------------------------------

General
* added root package org.springframework.config.java
* refactored classes and restructured packages
* moved unused/incomplete classses and packages to src/test folder

Package org.springframework.config.java.annotation
* annotation @ExternalBean added to allow injection of an already defined bean
* @Bean can forbid the overriding of the resulting bean by other bean definitions. Default is true
* @Bean.scope property was changed from the Scope enum (which was removed) to a String to allow custom scopes

Package org.springframework.config.java.annotation.aop
* added @ScopedProxy annotation, the equivalent of <aop:scoped-proxy/> tag

Package org.springframework.config.java.naming
* the method -> bean name translation is pluggable and used through out the code

Package org.springframework.config.java.process
* @Bean.metadata is translated into BeanDefinition attribute
* process returns the number of bean definitions created based on annotations
* ConfigurationProcessor#process() method refactored into #processClass(Class) and #processBean(String)
* ConfigurationProcessor constructor has changed requiring only the owning bean factory. The listener registry
as well as the naming strategy are optional (defaults are being used in case they aren't specified)
* ConfigurationProcessor implements InitializingBean to allow flexible configuration

Package org.springframework.config.java.support.cglib
* the cglib code has been improved, only one instance callback being used per processor
* the backing beanFactory is used for handling bean instances. Scopes are fully supported [SJC-9]

Package org.springframework.config.java.util
* added new package with two new utility classes: one for pasing the other for specifying Spring 2.0 default scopes


Changes in version 1.0-M1 (2006-11-28)
